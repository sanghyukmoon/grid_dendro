- {cite:t}`Mao2020`: FISO

{cite:t}`GongOstriker2011` developed and introduced a core finding method called GRID (GRavitatianal IDentification), which utilize isocontours of gravitational potential to provide physically motivated definition of bound cores. {cite:t}`Mao2020` extended this algorithm to identify hierarchical structures of the interstellar medium using dendrogram, as well as significantly improve the efficiency of the algorithm. The first author of {cite:t}`Mao2020` wrote a python pacakge [FISO](https://github.com/alwinm/fiso) (fast isocontours) to implement this algorithm.

`grid_dendro` is an implementation of an algorithm presented in {cite:t}`Mao2020`, written by refactoring the original [FISO](https://github.com/alwinm/fiso) code base to enhance readability and maintainability.
